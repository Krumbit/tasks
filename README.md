# [Tasks](https://tasks.krumb.it/)

A small but effective todo list app with an emphasis on the back-end.

## Features ‚úÖ 
- NextUI + Tailwind for *clean* UI
- Authentication with Clerk
- Whitelist authorization with Clerk Webhooks + Supabase
- Type-safe and secure Supabase DB access with Drizzle ORM and Next.js server actions
- State management with React Query and Zustand

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
If you wish to locally host a version of this app
### Requirements
* `git` command line ([Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) | [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) | [macOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)) installed
* `node` [Version 18.17](https://nodejs.org/en) or later installed
* `bun` ([macOS | Linux](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)) installed
  * Using bun through WSL will not work due to how Husky is setup. Sorry!

> Note: Although the Bun CLI and package manager are the ones used, Next.js requires you to have Node installed on your system - that is why both it and Bun appear in system requirements.
